        <abstract> What exactly is an open source company? What are the fundamental principles of building an open source company? It’s surprisingly common for founders of open source companies to lose sight of the foundational principles of building open source companies and of the challenges and opportunities that all open source companies share. In this talk, Emily Omier will provide her definition of an open source company and the foundations that the leads of open source companies should build on — as well as give examples of how getting the foundations right leads to better business outcomes.</abstract>

        <abstract> Spending 8 years in a deep tech VC fund with quite a few OSS investments, I can strongly say "classical VCs ruin everything" when it comes to open source. Thing is, VCs invest in companies, in products, in scaling... The list goes on, but it does not include community, effects on the industry or motivating developers. When you consider a system that takes all of this into account it's a way bigger picture then VCs and companies, it includes other parties from foundations to individual contributors, from local governments to infrastructure providers. So, can a VC make it "fair" and step back long enough to see all this elements and their motivations and invest accordingly? Well, my answer is clear as I'm not a VC anymore, building developer-centric OSS economy instead.</abstract>

        <abstract> Open Source Program Offices belong everywhere where open source is used. While it started in companies, we need OSPOs in government, in universities and all over the world. OSPOs help create a contact point, understanding and collaboration for open source to flourish and to be effective. OSPOs at companies act as the first place people inside and outside the company contact to navigate open source questions and policy. They help advocate for open source and to connect the business goals and open source for leadership. Even a small organization can have a one person or part-time open source role that helps with open source matters.
Organizations need to start with an understanding of how they use open source, why it matters to them and decide best way to organize.</abstract>

        <abstract> Many companies use open source in their development strategy, and the full potential of open source is best realized when technical strategies are paired with an effective business model and successful community engagement.
• How to choose which business model to adopt?
• How does open source add unique value for your product?
• How do you balance the commercial and open source offerings to ensure ROI?
• How do you collaborate with the community, do you understand what they actually value?
The commercialization journey of products built with or on open source is substantially different to those based on proprietary software. This talk outlines the 4 key steps to build a powerful open source strategy to maximize your open source value while minimizing risks for your organization.</abstract>

        <abstract> Do you feel it’s no longer enough to just be a great developer? Does advancing your career mean you have to be blogging, speaking at conferences, engaging on social media, committing to open source and other things distracting you from actually building software?

You’ll do well to ensure that the people making decisions about your career are hearing and seeing your name and associating it with progress and other cool and positive things (and truth, they probably aren’t looking at your code).

In this session we’ll explore some of the best practices that assist in not having to do it all from scratch. Knowing what you are doing can give you an easier path to visible contributions to the community.</abstract>

How can you expand your business when your model is giving away software for free – when folks can build their own business on top of it? Let's talk about what you can take from the traditional tech startup expansion plan and what just won't work, what you can do differently.</abstract>

        <abstract> Many companies are understanding the value of having open source contributors and maintainers in their ranks. Growing that open source culture internally is not as easy as simply hiring developers to “work on open source”. Martin and Phil both became open source contributors and, maintainers in the past decade with the support of company efforts to increase contributors. They learnt many lessons along the way and are taking that knowledge into leadership and mentoring roles at IBM and AWS.

In this talk, we’ll provide guidance for employees and technical leaders who are looking to invest in growing an open source culture at work. We’ll help detail the ways that open source investment is valuable both for the company and for the employee’s vitality and career.</abstract>

        <abstract> The Open Radio Station is a plug-and-play, autonomous 4G/5G base station based on open source hardware. With only 2.4kg and 32W, it provides private networks (industry, police, public safety, etc.) and public networks (mobile coverage extension, fixed wireless). It includes eNodeB/gNodeB, core network, mesh routing, MCPTT, OSS/BSS. All software is open source or licensed source.

We introduce the current hardware design of the ORS (2x1W, 40 Mhz) and how much can be achieved in terms of range (10 km) of number of users (up to 1000). We explain how open source hardware enable three independent supply chains in Europe and Asia.

We then introduce our roadmap towards 2x10W and 100 MHz to cover more use cases. We compare ORS hardware with other initiatives in open telecom.</abstract>

        <abstract> Creating open-source, industrial quality silicon IP collaboratively is difficult — much harder in fact than for software, due to tooling, supply chain, and manufacturing complexities. The Silicon Commons framework, developed by the OpenTitan partners (lowRISC, Google, Nuvoton, Western Digital, Seagate, Rivos, Winbond, zeroRISC, G+D, ETH Zurich and others) has enabled OpenTitan,— a collaboratively built, secure execution environment and the world’s most active open silicon design – to achieve production-grade readiness.

The Silicon Commons 'managed open' approach explored in this talk covers governance, coding standards, workflow, IP support, design verification, infrastructure, dashboards, documentation, certification processes, and more.</abstract>

        <abstract> In this talk, we present the development and benefits of open-source code linting tools in the realm of chip design and verification. As the complexity of semiconductor designs continues to rise, ensuring code quality and adherence to industry standards becomes a critical factor. The paper presents our recent work on developing an open-source SystemVerilog linter named PySlint based on open-source parser Slang and PySlang. Key aspects such as selection of the implementation platform (Python in our case), integration methodologies, and case studies illustrating successful implementations are explored, providing valuable insights for both industry practitioners and researchers in the field of chip design. Sample rules for SystemVerilog Assertions, DPI, Testbench, and UVM are presented.</abstract>

        <abstract> Every medical research team and opensource wearable team currently designs a device from scratch each time. The Herald Project has created a modular opensource wearable with multiple form factors. For the first time this provides teams with a largely complete, standards based, and open source hardware platform to add their unique flare too. This drastically reduces initial development time and cost. It brings wearable use into reach for medical students without Comp Sci degrees. For commercial companies it also reduces R&amp;D cost. The Herald V2 wearable aims to be the 'Raspberry Pi Compute Module' of the wearable world, supporting makers, researchers, and companies long-term. We will start by providing an eHealth Maker's kit using this form factor.</abstract>

        <abstract> At Codethink we believe in testing hardware as early in the development lifecycle as possible, automating this testing makes it efficient and reproducible. We invariably need a number of connections to hardware devices for both development and automated testing which ends up with a birds nest of wires, dongles and peripherals, we put our minds to putting all of these together in one box containing a SBC, an open source USB switch, Can interface and an open source I/O board for everything else, including a USB hub, serial connection, GPIO switches, optocouplers and HID emulation.
This talk is about the concept, design and implementation of the Testing in a Box project along with some of the use cases that we're already using it for.</abstract>

        <abstract> Accessibility often takes a backseat in open source software, creating barriers that exclude a significant portion of users and contributors. This talk spotlights this critical issue, advocating a shift in how we approach open source development.

We’ll delve into the essence of engineering accessible software, emphasising why accessibility should be a fundamental, not an afterthought. We’ll also explore practical strategies for embedding accessibility into the DNA of open source software, from the initial design to the final output.

By the end of the talk, attendees will have a clearer understanding of the importance of accessible open source software, and be empowered to take actionable steps towards creating more inclusive technology.</abstract>

        <abstract> The ease in adopting open source can lead to organizations using the software without considering its long-term viability. What happens when a project changes the license, stops making security updates, or has other issues that impact its usage? When a project that is incorporated into your products or services later becomes unviable, it can have negative implications for your users, customers, and reputation.

The presentation contains details about how to assess project policies, governance, security practices, adoption, and community dynamics that can impact the stability and overall viability of a project. The audience will walk away with practical advice about how to strategically evaluate the viability of open source projects and assess the risks and rewards for their situation.</abstract>

        <abstract> What exactly is an open source company? What are the fundamental principles of building an open source company? It’s surprisingly common for founders of open source companies to lose sight of the foundational principles of building open source companies and of the challenges and opportunities that all open source companies share. In this talk, Emily Omier will provide her definition of an open source company and the foundations that the leads of open source companies should build on — as well as give examples of how getting the foundations right leads to better business outcomes.</abstract>

However measuring mobile apps performance is complex for multiple reasons we'll explore together. I'll then explain how we built Flashlight, an open source Android performance profiler, to make performance measures and regression testing as easy and accessible as possible.</abstract>

        <abstract> The Open Radio Station is a plug-and-play, autonomous 4G/5G base station based on open source hardware. With only 2.4kg and 32W, it provides private networks (industry, police, public safety, etc.) and public networks (mobile coverage extension, fixed wireless). It includes eNodeB/gNodeB, core network, mesh routing, MCPTT, OSS/BSS. All software is open source or licensed source.

We introduce the current hardware design of the ORS (2x1W, 40 Mhz) and how much can be achieved in terms of range (10 km) of number of users (up to 1000). We explain how open source hardware enable three independent supply chains in Europe and Asia.

We then introduce our roadmap towards 2x10W and 100 MHz to cover more use cases. We compare ORS hardware with other initiatives in open telecom.</abstract>

Fortunately new &amp;lsquo;quantum-safe&amp;rsquo; algorithms are becoming available and standardized that can protect against these threats.&amp;nbsp;In this talk we will introduce the problem and show some of the work that is underway to mitigate the threat in open source. We&amp;rsquo;ll introduce some industry initiatives including the Open Quantum Safe project and its quantum-safe algorithm implementations, and cover some specifics for popular libraries such as OpenSSL.Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll share some further thoughts on what&amp;rsquo;s next and provide ways for those interested to be able to engage in initiatives to move our ecosystem forward.</abstract>

        <abstract> Spending 8 years in a deep tech VC fund with quite a few OSS investments, I can strongly say "classical VCs ruin everything" when it comes to open source. Thing is, VCs invest in companies, in products, in scaling... The list goes on, but it does not include community, effects on the industry or motivating developers. When you consider a system that takes all of this into account it's a way bigger picture then VCs and companies, it includes other parties from foundations to individual contributors, from local governments to infrastructure providers. So, can a VC make it "fair" and step back long enough to see all this elements and their motivations and invest accordingly? Well, my answer is clear as I'm not a VC anymore, building developer-centric OSS economy instead.</abstract>

Do we know what good looks like, are we in the best place to cope with new product growth, new technologies, massive scaling of AI, and the continued business environment of acquisitions and mergers? Where should we prioritise our investment in opensource capabilities?

This talk introduces the OpenChain maturity modelling framework. Laying out the best way to optimise investment in OpenSOurce capabilities. The framework combines the new OpenChain standard (ISO 5230) with best practice management experience.

Delegates will understand how to apply the OpenChain maturity model to their business, assess capabilities and develop an implementation plan to lead change.</abstract>

        <abstract> Creating open-source, industrial quality silicon IP collaboratively is difficult — much harder in fact than for software, due to tooling, supply chain, and manufacturing complexities. The Silicon Commons framework, developed by the OpenTitan partners (lowRISC, Google, Nuvoton, Western Digital, Seagate, Rivos, Winbond, zeroRISC, G+D, ETH Zurich and others) has enabled OpenTitan,— a collaboratively built, secure execution environment and the world’s most active open silicon design – to achieve production-grade readiness.

The Silicon Commons 'managed open' approach explored in this talk covers governance, coding standards, workflow, IP support, design verification, infrastructure, dashboards, documentation, certification processes, and more.</abstract>

        <abstract> SBOMs have started to become more mainstream, as companies are rushing to adopt. From the regulatory agencies, to governments, we're seeing the demand emerge. As companies struggle to figure out how to consume them, there are the snags from an imprecise definition, and multiple interpretations. Best practices for efficient generation and what makes a quality SBOM is causing a lot of head scratching and opining. Fresh from the SBOM devroom at FOSDEM, the overview of open source tool developers consider relevant as well the challenges for 2024 to get this all accurately automated will be discussed.</abstract>

        <abstract> The Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) is a UN-endorsed "initiative that facilitates the discovery and deployment of open-source technologies" for digital public infrastructure (DPI) &amp;ndash; an underlying network of components such as digital payments, identity, and data exchange systems thare are key to catalyze the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Once you've digested that mouthful of acronyms, as an open source enthusiast, you might notice a certain alignment of philosophy: yes... open source software should power our emerging digital society. But this challenge is not for the light-hearted. Even well-funded western governments are not paragons of successful digital transformation. Will the DPGA succeed? What does the UN know about software? And who will pay for it all? This session will cover the following: What is the DPGA? Who is behind it? What are its goals? What is the DPG Registry and the criteria to get listed? What are some successful projects in the Registry that have been successfully deployed by countries? What is the 50-in-5 initiative? What is the Govstack initiative? What are the business incentives for open source projects to participate in the DPGA? What are the unique challenges of accessibility for DPG software? What is the timeframe for action? What are the challenges the DGPA faces? What can you do if you want to get more involved? If the DPGA can provide some of the activation energy to catalyze adoption of open source software by national governments, it would be beneficial for both the public and private sectors to collaborate. The DPGA registration process also brings to light some important considerations regarding the business risks of open source software, and the best practices for long term innovation.</abstract>

        <abstract> Open Source Program Offices belong everywhere where open source is used. While it started in companies, we need OSPOs in government, in universities and all over the world. OSPOs help create a contact point, understanding and collaboration for open source to flourish and to be effective. OSPOs at companies act as the first place people inside and outside the company contact to navigate open source questions and policy. They help advocate for open source and to connect the business goals and open source for leadership. Even a small organization can have a one person or part-time open source role that helps with open source matters.
Organizations need to start with an understanding of how they use open source, why it matters to them and decide best way to organize.</abstract>

        <abstract> In a world where new programming languages, frameworks and libraries appear almost monthly, how is it that Java, a ~30-year-old language, has survived? Why do so many organisations still use Java to develop mission critical applications even when it was never designed for microservices or the cloud? Answer: the community!

In this session we’ll dive into how the Java community and open source has reinvigorated this language, exploring community-driven initiatives that continue to ensure Java not only survives, but thrives as a programming language of choice. We’ll cover Java User Groups, community support programs, the development of vendor-agnostic OSS specifications and open-sourced Java frameworks and runtimes. Join this session to see just how powerful the community and OSS can be!</abstract>

        <abstract> Many companies use open source in their development strategy, and the full potential of open source is best realized when technical strategies are paired with an effective business model and successful community engagement.
• How to choose which business model to adopt?
• How does open source add unique value for your product?
• How do you balance the commercial and open source offerings to ensure ROI?
• How do you collaborate with the community, do you understand what they actually value?
The commercialization journey of products built with or on open source is substantially different to those based on proprietary software. This talk outlines the 4 key steps to build a powerful open source strategy to maximize your open source value while minimizing risks for your organization.</abstract>

        <abstract> More and more, public organizations are embracing open source. But they often create something from scratch just for themselves, rather than making their codebase reusable and to be collaborated upon with their peers. Can a standard that makes it easier to collaborate help solve this problem?</abstract>

        <abstract> Chainguard started with a plan to build secure container images. They ended up building a whole new Linux (un)distribution and tooling.

Linux distributions haven't really changed a lot since they were installed via floppy disk. They are designed for a bygone era of local hardware and it's starting to show. Wolfi is a rethinking of what a Linux distribution can be, focused on modern cloud native workloads and containers in particular.

We'll talk about Wolfi's primary use case as a foundation for hardened, up-to-date container images and why existing distributions didn't work for us. We'll explain why we call Wolfi an "undistro" and the underpinning philisophy and technology involved.

Finally, we'll talk about the future, the importance of community and how you can get involved!</abstract>

        <abstract> Central to effective cybersecurity is a fundamental yet often overlooked task: knowing exactly what needs to be secured. This foundational aspect, is increasingly challenging in today's fast-paced and dynamic technological landscapes. Organizations grappling with this issue find it especially pronounced in modern, fluid environments where assets can rapidly change or scale.

This talk will dive into this area, give you ideas of what you need to consider, look at some common problem areas and also show where it's possible to leverage emerging technologies like Open Telemetry to improve your companies security.</abstract>

        <abstract> Do you feel it’s no longer enough to just be a great developer? Does advancing your career mean you have to be blogging, speaking at conferences, engaging on social media, committing to open source and other things distracting you from actually building software?

You’ll do well to ensure that the people making decisions about your career are hearing and seeing your name and associating it with progress and other cool and positive things (and truth, they probably aren’t looking at your code).

In this session we’ll explore some of the best practices that assist in not having to do it all from scratch. Knowing what you are doing can give you an easier path to visible contributions to the community.</abstract>

        <abstract> In this talk, we present the development and benefits of open-source code linting tools in the realm of chip design and verification. As the complexity of semiconductor designs continues to rise, ensuring code quality and adherence to industry standards becomes a critical factor. The paper presents our recent work on developing an open-source SystemVerilog linter named PySlint based on open-source parser Slang and PySlang. Key aspects such as selection of the implementation platform (Python in our case), integration methodologies, and case studies illustrating successful implementations are explored, providing valuable insights for both industry practitioners and researchers in the field of chip design. Sample rules for SystemVerilog Assertions, DPI, Testbench, and UVM are presented.</abstract>

        <abstract> AI is now entering an era when it isn’t just an application of computing but rather a radically different way of how computational systems can be engineered. If we want to maintain the same collaborative setting we are used to in open source software, we need to consider what parts of our open source legacy we take into the future and what parts we need to reinvent. This session will cover topics ranging from impact of Generative AI to the fact that the traditional view of open source code implementing AI algorithms may not be sufficient to guarantee inspectability, modifiability and replicability. We will touch upon ongoing government efforts creating policies regulating AI and more specifically OSS AI proliferation, as well as efforts from foundations (OSI, Apache and Linux Foundations)</abstract>

        <abstract> Triaging vulnerabilities can be burdensome for strained open source maintainers and their users. Even more so when false positives make up the bulk of the vulnerability reports!

Enter OpenVEX - a lightweight implementation of the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange. VEX is a document-based communications channel designed to complement SBOM, enabling maintainers to communicate the effect that a vulnerability has on a piece of software.

With OpenVEX, projects can emit messages, silencing scanner noise and letting users focus on the most important vulnerabilities.

OpenVEX is a project under the Open Source Security Foundation and has support in major vulnerability scanners. In the talk, Adolfo will introduce OpenVEX and its tools with practical use cases across open source.</abstract>

        <abstract> Platform as a Product might sound like a new buzzword but we’ve actually been talking about this concept for at least 7 years. In this talk, Paula will define what Platform as a Product is and how it is evolving with the increased industry focus on Platform Engineering. She’ll give real world examples of how organisations are applying a product mindset to their platform, covering the benefits that this can drive as well as the mistakes that can happen.
And there’ll be a call to action for the open source community to contribute to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation Platforms Working Group as they are researching how companies are succeeding with Platform as a Product.</abstract>

        <abstract> Open Banking was intended to provide consumer choice by enabling customers to pick and choose their service providers while their traditional high street bank provided safe custody. The reality however is very little has changed in the banking ecosystem with most FinTechs and Neo Banks requiring customer to transfer funds to them. The core of the problem lies with two data points: control of industry data an control of customer data. In order to truly deliver on the promises of 'open banking', we need to start with 'open data'; creating a level playing field between customers and their financial service providers.</abstract>

        <abstract> Every medical research team and opensource wearable team currently designs a device from scratch each time. The Herald Project has created a modular opensource wearable with multiple form factors. For the first time this provides teams with a largely complete, standards based, and open source hardware platform to add their unique flare too. This drastically reduces initial development time and cost. It brings wearable use into reach for medical students without Comp Sci degrees. For commercial companies it also reduces R&amp;D cost. The Herald V2 wearable aims to be the 'Raspberry Pi Compute Module' of the wearable world, supporting makers, researchers, and companies long-term. We will start by providing an eHealth Maker's kit using this form factor.</abstract>

        <abstract> Our open publishing of primary care prescribing datasets and data science save lives, improves patient care and save the NHS millions of pounds every year. The NHS Business Services Authority is responsible for delivery services that account for around £43 billion of NHS spend annually. As a result, we collect and hold one of the richest and most diverse NHS datasets and put this to use through data products, data science and open data publications. Attendees can learn from our experience and outputs around the primary care prescribing data we hold and the impact this had on patient care. We will deep dive on the NHSBSA Open Data Portal and a fascinating open science project around care home prescribing and how its being used to help prevent falls and serious injury.</abstract>

        <abstract> What if you can’t afford the “F” in FOSS? In a country that’s struggling economically, can you afford to open source even parts of your product?
The “F” in FOSS stands for free; what if the society itself struggles with freedom of speech, creativity, and expression?

In this talk, we will cover the immense challenges that open source faces in developing countries. We'll also go through approaches and measures that can be taken to build an open source culture in these regions.</abstract>

        <abstract> Since OpenAI ChatGPT's public unveiling, interest in large language models (LLMs) and AI has surged. Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) have diligently explored strategies to exploit these paradigms, aiming to optimize the performance and enhance troubleshooting efficiency in large distributes system like Kubernetes.
However, current solutions often utilize public APIs, limiting control over data sent to the API provider and raising security concerns, particularly when troubleshooting production systems containing proprietary data.
In this talk, we're going to introduce LocalAI, an open source project on the rise, to facilitate the operation of these models locally, obviating the need for an internet connection.

        <abstract> This conference session delves into the critical success factors driving effective open AI ecosystems. Open data is vital for artificial intelligence (AI), and many of the most impactful open datasets for AI are built, developed and managed by communities, such as Wikipedia, the largest body of knowledge in the world. Building and sustaining these communities is difficult, and the advent of generative AI provides additional questions for these communities.

This session, "Open AI Ecosystems: Ingredients for Success" brings open data community experts together to explore the success factors for these communities, and what the future with generative AI will bring.</abstract>

        <abstract> Open-source software utilizes collaborative practices to engage communities and enhance the diversity of knowledge and knowledge producers. Despite the diverse sets of goals and challenges across sectors and disciplines, open source helps provide equitable access to technology and aims to make knowledge freely available for global benefit. Despite the tremendous progress, many questions in open source remain: How to build an open culture where diverse stakeholders of society participate not just in accessing knowledge, but in its production, circulation, and societal benefit? How to embed the DEI principles? How to reduce and tackle the environmental harms of technology?
To answer these, I turn to the Do No Harm principle and apply them to enhance open source/science sustainability.</abstract>

        <abstract> Worldwide, we spend close to 2 trillion dollars per year for the loaded cost of software developers.

If every company spent just 0.05% of that amount to fund open source maintainers, we’d unlock a billion dollars per year to fund the maintenance of open source.

That would pay the full time salaries for thousands of maintainers, their managers, security training, etc.

That seems fairly cheap for software that accounts for 70% to 97% of our software stack depending on how you count. And just imagine the positive impact on the security of our software supply chain!

What are we waiting for?</abstract>

        <abstract> At Codethink we believe in testing hardware as early in the development lifecycle as possible, automating this testing makes it efficient and reproducible. We invariably need a number of connections to hardware devices for both development and automated testing which ends up with a birds nest of wires, dongles and peripherals, we put our minds to putting all of these together in one box containing a SBC, an open source USB switch, Can interface and an open source I/O board for everything else, including a USB hub, serial connection, GPIO switches, optocouplers and HID emulation.
This talk is about the concept, design and implementation of the Testing in a Box project along with some of the use cases that we're already using it for.</abstract>

        <abstract> AI systems such as Retrieval Augmented Generation promise to revolutionize how we find and consume information - but can we trust what they create? To evaluate and fine-tune the outputs of these systems, so they are useful in commercial settings, we need effective ways to measure them at every stage. Luckily open source tools and techniques exist to help. This talk will deliver a pragmatic overview of modern search &amp; AI systems and how to build them with open methods and technology, based on over twenty years experience of the information retrieval world.</abstract>

        <abstract> The term "Open Source" typically refers to the license a project uses, but is having an Open Source license sufficient for a project to embody all the values commonly associated with Open Source Software? Perhaps not. In this presentation, we will discuss what other aspects of a Project need to be assessed for long-term adoption. This includes factors like the availability of binaries and quality documentation, governance structure, community size and activity, along with several other important criteria.</abstract>

        <abstract> Many companies are understanding the value of having open source contributors and maintainers in their ranks. Growing that open source culture internally is not as easy as simply hiring developers to “work on open source”. Martin and Phil both became open source contributors and, maintainers in the past decade with the support of company efforts to increase contributors. They learnt many lessons along the way and are taking that knowledge into leadership and mentoring roles at IBM and AWS.

In this talk, we’ll provide guidance for employees and technical leaders who are looking to invest in growing an open source culture at work. We’ll help detail the ways that open source investment is valuable both for the company and for the employee’s vitality and career.</abstract>

        <abstract> China stands as a significant adopter of open-source software and hosts numerous renowned open-source projects. With open source being incorporated into the government's 14th Five-Year Plan in 2021, there was a notable surge in China's open-source ecosystem. However, this growth also brought various challenges, including hurdles in commercializing open-source startups, a lack of metrics for enterprises to gauge their involvement in open source, and internal governance regarding open-source compliance, etc.

In a concise 15-minute talk, the speaker aims to offer a swift overview of the current landscape of open-source development in China, intending to assist those interested in China or aiming to enter the Chinese market to swiftly grasp the evolution of open source within the country.</abstract>

        <abstract> Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Scorecards provide a way for open source users to determine whether maintainers are being diligent about securing their link in the software security supply chain. Practices such as pinning dependencies, branch protection, required reviews, continuous integration tests etc. are measured to provide a score and accompanying badge.

This presentation will provide a walkthrough of the steps involved in securing a first repository, and then what it takes to repeat that process across and organization with multiple repos. It will also look at the ongoing maintenance involved once scorecards have been implemented, and how aspects of that maintenance can be better automated to minimize toil.</abstract>

        <language>en</language>
        <abstract> In this talk we delve into the intricacies of reshaping the governance model of an established open source project. This daunting task materialised for Mautic in April 2023 when the project's primary funder and founding company stepped back, enabling it to become fully independent.

The session unpacks the challenges, solutions, and lessons learned from this real-life scenario, providing an insight into how the Mautic community deftly adapted to this shift. It provides a deep dive into the creation and implementation of a new governance model and decision-making process, transforming a potential period of instability into an opportunity for democratisation and collaboration.

The session also offers a practical perspective on enabling democratic decision-making via a new Community Portal.</abstract>

        <abstract> The ease in adopting open source can lead to organizations using the software without considering its long-term viability. What happens when a project changes the license, stops making security updates, or has other issues that impact its usage? When a project that is incorporated into your products or services later becomes unviable, it can have negative implications for your users, customers, and reputation.

The presentation contains details about how to assess project policies, governance, security practices, adoption, and community dynamics that can impact the stability and overall viability of a project. The audience will walk away with practical advice about how to strategically evaluate the viability of open source projects and assess the risks and rewards for their situation.</abstract>

        <abstract> In a world where new programming languages, frameworks and libraries appear almost monthly, how is it that Java, a ~30-year-old language, has survived? Why do so many organisations still use Java to develop mission critical applications even when it was never designed for microservices or the cloud? Answer: the community!

In this session we’ll dive into how the Java community and open source has reinvigorated this language, exploring community-driven initiatives that continue to ensure Java not only survives, but thrives as a programming language of choice. We’ll cover Java User Groups, community support programs, the development of vendor-agnostic OSS specifications and open-sourced Java frameworks and runtimes. Join this session to see just how powerful the community and OSS can be!</abstract>

        <abstract> AI is now entering an era when it isn’t just an application of computing but rather a radically different way of how computational systems can be engineered. If we want to maintain the same collaborative setting we are used to in open source software, we need to consider what parts of our open source legacy we take into the future and what parts we need to reinvent. This session will cover topics ranging from impact of Generative AI to the fact that the traditional view of open source code implementing AI algorithms may not be sufficient to guarantee inspectability, modifiability and replicability. We will touch upon ongoing government efforts creating policies regulating AI and more specifically OSS AI proliferation, as well as efforts from foundations (OSI, Apache and Linux Foundations)</abstract>

        <abstract> What if you can’t afford the “F” in FOSS? In a country that’s struggling economically, can you afford to open source even parts of your product?
The “F” in FOSS stands for free; what if the society itself struggles with freedom of speech, creativity, and expression?

In this talk, we will cover the immense challenges that open source faces in developing countries. We'll also go through approaches and measures that can be taken to build an open source culture in these regions.</abstract>

        <abstract> Worldwide, we spend close to 2 trillion dollars per year for the loaded cost of software developers.

If every company spent just 0.05% of that amount to fund open source maintainers, we’d unlock a billion dollars per year to fund the maintenance of open source.

That would pay the full time salaries for thousands of maintainers, their managers, security training, etc.

That seems fairly cheap for software that accounts for 70% to 97% of our software stack depending on how you count. And just imagine the positive impact on the security of our software supply chain!

What are we waiting for?</abstract>

        <abstract> In this talk we delve into the intricacies of reshaping the governance model of an established open source project. This daunting task materialised for Mautic in April 2023 when the project's primary funder and founding company stepped back, enabling it to become fully independent.

The session unpacks the challenges, solutions, and lessons learned from this real-life scenario, providing an insight into how the Mautic community deftly adapted to this shift. It provides a deep dive into the creation and implementation of a new governance model and decision-making process, transforming a potential period of instability into an opportunity for democratisation and collaboration.

The session also offers a practical perspective on enabling democratic decision-making via a new Community Portal.</abstract>

        <abstract> Accessibility often takes a backseat in open source software, creating barriers that exclude a significant portion of users and contributors. This talk spotlights this critical issue, advocating a shift in how we approach open source development.

We’ll delve into the essence of engineering accessible software, emphasising why accessibility should be a fundamental, not an afterthought. We’ll also explore practical strategies for embedding accessibility into the DNA of open source software, from the initial design to the final output.

By the end of the talk, attendees will have a clearer understanding of the importance of accessible open source software, and be empowered to take actionable steps towards creating more inclusive technology.</abstract>

        <abstract> The top-selling Android phone performs 10x worse than the best selling iOS phone. To ensure our apps are usable on a wide range of devices, optimizing performance is crucial.
However measuring mobile apps performance is complex for multiple reasons we'll explore together. I'll then explain how we built Flashlight, an open source Android performance profiler, to make performance measures and regression testing as easy and accessible as possible.</abstract>

        <abstract> SBOMs have started to become more mainstream, as companies are rushing to adopt. From the regulatory agencies, to governments, we're seeing the demand emerge. As companies struggle to figure out how to consume them, there are the snags from an imprecise definition, and multiple interpretations. Best practices for efficient generation and what makes a quality SBOM is causing a lot of head scratching and opining. Fresh from the SBOM devroom at FOSDEM, the overview of open source tool developers consider relevant as well the challenges for 2024 to get this all accurately automated will be discussed.</abstract>

        <abstract> Chainguard started with a plan to build secure container images. They ended up building a whole new Linux (un)distribution and tooling.

Linux distributions haven't really changed a lot since they were installed via floppy disk. They are designed for a bygone era of local hardware and it's starting to show. Wolfi is a rethinking of what a Linux distribution can be, focused on modern cloud native workloads and containers in particular.

We'll talk about Wolfi's primary use case as a foundation for hardened, up-to-date container images and why existing distributions didn't work for us. We'll explain why we call Wolfi an "undistro" and the underpinning philisophy and technology involved.

Finally, we'll talk about the future, the importance of community and how you can get involved!</abstract>

        <abstract> Platform as a Product might sound like a new buzzword but we’ve actually been talking about this concept for at least 7 years. In this talk, Paula will define what Platform as a Product is and how it is evolving with the increased industry focus on Platform Engineering. She’ll give real world examples of how organisations are applying a product mindset to their platform, covering the benefits that this can drive as well as the mistakes that can happen.
And there’ll be a call to action for the open source community to contribute to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation Platforms Working Group as they are researching how companies are succeeding with Platform as a Product.</abstract>

        <abstract> Since OpenAI ChatGPT's public unveiling, interest in large language models (LLMs) and AI has surged. Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) have diligently explored strategies to exploit these paradigms, aiming to optimize the performance and enhance troubleshooting efficiency in large distributes system like Kubernetes.
However, current solutions often utilize public APIs, limiting control over data sent to the API provider and raising security concerns, particularly when troubleshooting production systems containing proprietary data.
In this talk, we're going to introduce LocalAI, an open source project on the rise, to facilitate the operation of these models locally, obviating the need for an internet connection.
Join us to meet your new best friend to run Kubernetes in production!</abstract>

To evaluate and fine-tune the outputs of these systems, so they are useful in commercial settings, we need effective ways to measure them at every stage. Luckily open source tools and techniques exist to help. This talk will deliver a pragmatic overview of modern search &amp; AI systems and how to build them with open methods and technology, based on over twenty years experience of the information retrieval world.</abstract>

        <abstract> Data portals have become a key part of open data initiatives over the past decade. The open source CKAN software has been used to power data portals around the world has recently been endorsed as a "digital public good" with potential to contribute to addressing UN Sustainable Development Goals. How have data portals changed over the past decade? How do they invite engagement with open data? How can they be researched? How might research on data portal software, interfaces and metadata suggest new directions for design, implementation and good practice? This panel convenes data portal researchers and developers from CKAN, King’s College London, Link Digital, Open Data Institute and the Public Data Lab to share and discuss the past, present and futures of software for making data public.</abstract>

        <abstract> Open Banking was intended to provide consumer choice by enabling customers to pick and choose their service providers while their traditional high street bank provided safe custody. The reality however is very little has changed in the banking ecosystem with most FinTechs and Neo Banks requiring customer to transfer funds to them. The core of the problem lies with two data points: control of industry data an control of customer data. In order to truly deliver on the promises of 'open banking', we need to start with 'open data'; creating a level playing field between customers and their financial service providers.</abstract>

        <abstract> Our open publishing of primary care prescribing datasets and data science save lives, improves patient care and save the NHS millions of pounds every year. The NHS Business Services Authority is responsible for delivery services that account for around £43 billion of NHS spend annually. As a result, we collect and hold one of the richest and most diverse NHS datasets and put this to use through data products, data science and open data publications. Attendees can learn from our experience and outputs around the primary care prescribing data we hold and the impact this had on patient care. We will deep dive on the NHSBSA Open Data Portal and a fascinating open science project around care home prescribing and how its being used to help prevent falls and serious injury.</abstract>

        <abstract> This conference session delves into the critical success factors driving effective open AI ecosystems. Open data is vital for artificial intelligence (AI), and many of the most impactful open datasets for AI are built, developed and managed by communities, such as Wikipedia, the largest body of knowledge in the world. Building and sustaining these communities is difficult, and the advent of generative AI provides additional questions for these communities.

This session, "Open AI Ecosystems: Ingredients for Success" brings open data community experts together to explore the success factors for these communities, and what the future with generative AI will bring.</abstract>

        <abstract> During this session, the following key points will be discussed:- Why mainstream search engines cannot discover all the published open data.- Why the discovered data are not necessarily AI ready.- How&amp;nbsp;https://dtechtive.com&amp;nbsp;leverages AI to make open data hidden in the deep web (not the dark web!) more discoverable and AI-ready.- How the solution brings data users and providers closer together by generating and sharing valuable insights.- A case study on the open data discoverability challenge in Scotland and how this was addressed through&amp;nbsp;https://find.data.gov.scot&amp;nbsp;(a portal powered by Dtechtive).The audience will takeaway the following key points:- While data are being published and made available online through different sources, they are not necessarily finding them using search engines (they don't know what they don't know) because of the diverse ways in which they are published.- With the advancements in AI, now it's possible to make such data more discoverable and usable.</abstract>

        <abstract> Quantum computing poses a threat to our existing cryptographic systems through &amp;lsquo;harvest now, decrypt later&amp;rsquo; attacks. Fortunately new &amp;lsquo;quantum-safe&amp;rsquo; algorithms are becoming available and standardized that can protect against these threats.&amp;nbsp;In this talk we will introduce the problem and show some of the work that is underway to mitigate the threat in open source. We&amp;rsquo;ll introduce some industry initiatives including the Open Quantum Safe project and its quantum-safe algorithm implementations, and cover some specifics for popular libraries such as OpenSSL.Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll share some further thoughts on what&amp;rsquo;s next and provide ways for those interested to be able to engage in initiatives to move our ecosystem forward.</abstract>

        <abstract> Central to effective cybersecurity is a fundamental yet often overlooked task: knowing exactly what needs to be secured. This foundational aspect, is increasingly challenging in today's fast-paced and dynamic technological landscapes. Organizations grappling with this issue find it especially pronounced in modern, fluid environments where assets can rapidly change or scale.

This talk will dive into this area, give you ideas of what you need to consider, look at some common problem areas and also show where it's possible to leverage emerging technologies like Open Telemetry to improve your companies security.</abstract>

        <abstract> Triaging vulnerabilities can be burdensome for strained open source maintainers and their users. Even more so when false positives make up the bulk of the vulnerability reports!

Enter OpenVEX - a lightweight implementation of the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange. VEX is a document-based communications channel designed to complement SBOM, enabling maintainers to communicate the effect that a vulnerability has on a piece of software.

With OpenVEX, projects can emit messages, silencing scanner noise and letting users focus on the most important vulnerabilities.

OpenVEX is a project under the Open Source Security Foundation and has support in major vulnerability scanners. In the talk, Adolfo will introduce OpenVEX and its tools with practical use cases across open source.</abstract>

        <abstract> A tsunami of Generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Model applications are changing technology and the world as we know it. In this talk, Vicente Herrera, employing his expertise will show us the many security risks that can be associated with AI projects, specially when using open source. Old threats persists, but new ones lurks in the dark.&amp;nbsp; He will point his torchlight to reveal them, and expose to all of us the dangers on security, bias and fairness, and safety in general that could lead to a huge risk on massive adoption at planetary scale. But we are not alone in this fight, as he will teach us about the guidelines, best practices, standards and legislation at our disposal to make sure this AI future that comes is secure for everyone.</abstract>

        <abstract> Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Scorecards provide a way for open source users to determine whether maintainers are being diligent about securing their link in the software security supply chain. Practices such as pinning dependencies, branch protection, required reviews, continuous integration tests etc. are measured to provide a score and accompanying badge.

This presentation will provide a walkthrough of the steps involved in securing a first repository, and then what it takes to repeat that process across and organization with multiple repos. It will also look at the ongoing maintenance involved once scorecards have been implemented, and how aspects of that maintenance can be better automated to minimize toil.</abstract>

        <abstract> The Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) is a UN-endorsed "initiative that facilitates the discovery and deployment of open-source technologies" for digital public infrastructure (DPI) &amp;ndash; an underlying network of components such as digital payments, identity, and data exchange systems thare are key to catalyze the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Once you've digested that mouthful of acronyms, as an open source enthusiast, you might notice a certain alignment of philosophy: yes... open source software should power our emerging digital society. But this challenge is not for the light-hearted. Even well-funded western governments are not paragons of successful digital transformation. Will the DPGA succeed? What does the UN know about software? And who will pay for it all? This session will cover the following: What is the DPGA? Who is behind it? What are its goals? What is the DPG Registry and the criteria to get listed? What are some successful projects in the Registry that have been successfully deployed by countries? What is the 50-in-5 initiative? What is the Govstack initiative? What are the business incentives for open source projects to participate in the DPGA? What are the unique challenges of accessibility for DPG software? What is the timeframe for action? What are the challenges the DGPA faces? What can you do if you want to get more involved? If the DPGA can provide some of the activation energy to catalyze adoption of open source software by national governments, it would be beneficial for both the public and private sectors to collaborate. The DPGA registration process also brings to light some important considerations regarding the business risks of open source software, and the best practices for long term innovation.</abstract>

        <abstract> More and more, public organizations are embracing open source. But they often create something from scratch just for themselves, rather than making their codebase reusable and to be collaborated upon with their peers. Can a standard that makes it easier to collaborate help solve this problem?</abstract>

        <abstract> In the dynamic world of open technology, where data flows as freely as conversations in a crowded room, ensuring privacy and security is paramount. In this talk we explore how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are evolving to create secure, invisible spaces for sensitive data processing. We'll illustrate how confidential computing safeguards information in government and public policy sectors. Attendees will gain insights into the intricate balance of openness and security, understanding the critical role of TEEs in protecting a digital dialogue of algorithmic assets.</abstract>

        <abstract> You have written some great open source software, but do you know who is using it? Well increasing software transparency may be about to become your best friend as legislation is requiring software producers to provide details of all of the components that have been used in creating a product. And that means open source software use is going to become much more visible.</abstract>

        <abstract> Open-source software utilizes collaborative practices to engage communities and enhance the diversity of knowledge and knowledge producers. Despite the diverse sets of goals and challenges across sectors and disciplines, open source helps provide equitable access to technology and aims to make knowledge freely available for global benefit. Despite the tremendous progress, many questions in open source remain: How to build an open culture where diverse stakeholders of society participate not just in accessing knowledge, but in its production, circulation, and societal benefit? How to embed the DEI principles? How to reduce and tackle the environmental harms of technology?
To answer these, I turn to the Do No Harm principle and apply them to enhance open source/science sustainability.</abstract>

        <abstract> The term "Open Source" typically refers to the license a project uses, but is having an Open Source license sufficient for a project to embody all the values commonly associated with Open Source Software? Perhaps not. In this presentation, we will discuss what other aspects of a Project need to be assessed for long-term adoption. This includes factors like the availability of binaries and quality documentation, governance structure, community size and activity, along with several other important criteria.</abstract>

        <abstract> China stands as a significant adopter of open-source software and hosts numerous renowned open-source projects. With open source being incorporated into the government's 14th Five-Year Plan in 2021, there was a notable surge in China's open-source ecosystem. However, this growth also brought various challenges, including hurdles in commercializing open-source startups, a lack of metrics for enterprises to gauge their involvement in open source, and internal governance regarding open-source compliance, etc.

In a concise 15-minute talk, the speaker aims to offer a swift overview of the current landscape of open-source development in China, intending to assist those interested in China or aiming to enter the Chinese market to swiftly grasp the evolution of open source within the country.</abstract>

        <abstract> With the rise of AI and automation, how do we as humans find our value in the workplace? How do we work with these new technologises? How do we build resilience to changes? What skills are needed for us to thrive in this new world?

People have often felt apprehensive about change, especially big changes to the way we work. It happened in the industrial revolution and now it's happening with the rise of artificial intelligence. Five years ago these things existed, but now they are accessible to almost everyone. 

In this session I'll cover:
- the age of AI
- what skills are needed for the "future of work"
- working with AI
- how we build resilience, problem solving, and critical thinking</abstract>

        <abstract> As you're building an organization, finding the right people to join is critical. Whether you're hiring a team member or bringing on an advisor, they can be your friend or foe. Knowing how to utilize those advisors is crucial. The right elements will help you scale, while the wrong choices will slow you down. Kelly has spent the past three years leading a nonprofit organization. She has hired and lost a team member, brought on volunteer leaders, and implemented an advisory board. Some of these choices were good, and she would repeat them. Others, have not turned out as well and have served as learning experiences. Join her as she shares lessons learned, provides suggestions on how to find the right people, and facilitates discussion on how to maximize your opportunities and spend to scale.</abstract>

        <abstract> The ambition of the Global Open Science Hardware community is to make Open Science Hardware ubiquitous by 2025.
Despite its contribution to knowledge and improving the lack of diversity and access to research equipment, the adoption of OSH faces serious challenges. Barriers include legal, technical and economic. To help the community overcome these barriers we looked at another global movement towards open science namely the FAIR data principles community. When researchers comply with the principles which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable they contribute to enhancing data stewardship and sharing in science. We would like to present our findings for feedback and discussion.</abstract>

        <abstract> More and more apps are being developed which consume AI. AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017 and companies are promoting an AI first strategy. But if a developer wants to consume AI in their applications, do they need to be an AI expert?

In this talk app developers will learn how they can treat AI the same as any other "function". This is made possible by open source AI frameworks that enables users to manage models through dev friendly APIs. Discussion will revolve around open source frameworks like Ray, Triton and TorchServe, to give an understanding of the tools available to help on the AI journey. I'll demo a runtime in action by loading open source models from Hugging Face and querying the models through a web UI.</abstract>

        <abstract> As more Banks &amp; Financial Service firms adopt Open Source, there’s been a huge spike in Open Source patent attacks. According to research from RPX, from 2020-21 industry patent litigation grew by 100%, almost 3 times more than the next closest sector. In 2023, the use of Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Spark &amp; Node.js have all been subjects of lawsuits filed against Financial Service companies. Global Banks &amp; Financial Service companies — from Barclays &amp; NatWest to Uber &amp; Worldline — are not only turning to Open Source for technology innovation but they are also being proactive, seeking alternative solutions for patent risk protection &amp; revising patent strategies.</abstract>

Stream formed in Apr-20 when a group of 11 water companies came together &amp; validated the need for open data in the sector
The group felt that if the benefits of open data in the sector were to be maximised then collaboration would be the best way to go - on the basis that if you want to go fast, go it alone but if you want to go far, go together
Since then, more water companies, regulators, &amp; SMEs have come on board &amp; Stream was successful in securing delivery funding earlier this year from the Ofwat innovation fund
Hear our progress so far, what you can expect to see &amp; when, the role water companies &amp; their stakeholders play &amp; the lessons learnt since the 1st conversations in 2020.</abstract>

People have often felt apprehensive about change, especially big changes to the way we work. It happened in the industrial revolution and now it's happening with the rise of artificial intelligence. Five years ago these things existed, but now they are accessible to almost everyone. 

In this session I'll cover:
- the age of AI
- what skills are needed for the "future of work"
- working with AI
- how we build resilience, problem solving, and critical thinking</abstract>

        <abstract> The CHERIoT Platform is the result of a hardware-software co-design project to build a secure foundation for embedded, connected devices. The project began at Microsoft and is now developed by multiple companies. The core platform includes an open ISA, an open-source core implementing that ISA, and an open-source software stack. With a very small hardware budget, this provides complete memory safety for legacy C/C++ code, and lightweight compartmentalisation that is easy to apply. Commercial silicon is expected in 2024.</abstract>

In this panel discussion, we will explore how data has the power to address health disparities and revolutionise healthcare, particularly if we look beyond clinical data alone. And how new approaches to data stewardship are needed to help unlock the full power of data to improve health and save lives, and to do this in a trustworthy way to forge a path towards a healthier and more equitable future for all.</abstract>

        <abstract> Join this session to hear how the Citi OSPO reduces process friction to allow developers to focus on contributing code to open source projects. We’ll cover how Citi designed our Open Source contribution policy to have a streamlined low-touch governance work-flow (for things like approvals, mitigating risk, and user agreements) and use tooling to prevent data leakage. Hear real-life practical examples of how contributing to open source has improved the Citi developer experience, diversity of thought, productivity, code quality and security.</abstract>

        <abstract> The ambition of the Global Open Science Hardware community is to make Open Science Hardware ubiquitous by 2025.
Despite its contribution to knowledge and improving the lack of diversity and access to research equipment, the adoption of OSH faces serious challenges. Barriers include legal, technical and economic. To help the community overcome these barriers we looked at another global movement towards open science namely the FAIR data principles community. When researchers comply with the principles which stand for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable they contribute to enhancing data stewardship and sharing in science. We would like to present our findings for feedback and discussion.</abstract>

        <abstract> Internal developer platforms are inherently bespoke to an organisation because, well, they are internal! At the same time, they are most effective when built as a thin layer above a number of other, lower level platforms that may be less custom. This talk will showcase how three OSS solutions are teaming up to enable an end to end platform experience that can empower organisations to forego settling on third party proprietary software without paying an unreasonable cost to build their solution in house.</abstract>

        <abstract> Founders and maintainers of open source projects have a good idea of what is needed from a technology standpoint to grow their project and provide technology value. But there are many other things to consider such as how to talk about the business value, marketing activities, and community building that gives the project the needed boost that accelerates the time to project success.

In this talk, I will bring my experience and insights on best practices for marketing, advocacy, and community building for open source projects that you can use to help you grow your project. I will outline steps you can take and specific things you can do to improve your success with your project and taking your project through Foundation maturity levels.</abstract>

        <abstract> Because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many engineers and admins try to avoid upgrading the kernel too often for the sake of stability. There is a tendency to create more obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals etc). But introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any other software usually significantly increases the risk for the company and their service of being exploited.

One of the reasons SREs and engineers are afraid of ANY kernel upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about the Linux kernel release process. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix release from a feature release.</abstract>

        <abstract> Today, almost all software heavily relies on the use of third-party dependencies. While open source modules are undoubtedly awesome, they also represent an undeniable and massive risk. You’re introducing someone else’s code into your system, often with little or no scrutiny. Including the wrong package can introduce severe vulnerabilities, exposing your application and your user’s data.

We’ll look at examples in the wild that have been exposed, some more famously than others, before showing you how to guard against these important security issues.</abstract>

        <abstract> This talk explores the world of firmware, the most privileged software that powers every device, and is traditional proprietary. We will dive into the history of firmware to understand its evolution and focus on how open-source firmware has been gaining ground over the past two decades.

Despite facing challenges in gaining widespread acceptance within the industry, open-source firmware has made significant leaps forward in recent years. These advancements show the growing momentum of open-source firmware.

        <abstract> The "classic" model of an Open Source Program Office has been a centralized organizational resource that serves as a technical, legal, and cultural resource for all things open source in an organization.

But the growing success of open source may be putting a unique form of pressure on the existence of OSPOs. In organizations where community best practices are in general use, the need for a large centralized OSPO may be perceived as unnecessary. If everyone knows how open source works, the argument goes, why do you need an OSPO?

In this talk, Red Hat OSPO's Brian Proffitt will describe how even in a mature open source organization, OSPOs are still very necessary, but that their shape might change.</abstract>

        <abstract> Managing an Open Source Program Office (OSPO) team is undoubtedly a unique experience. In this talk I will discuss the unique challenges and best practices for managing software developers in an OSPO environment. I will cover topics such as managing remote teams, maintaining the career progression of OSPO developers, fostering a culture of collaboration and collaborating with the open source community. I will also explore the role of performance metrics in managing software developers in an OSPO, how to align those metrics withe the goals of the organization and how to help developers balance the needs of the organization with the needs of the open source community.</abstract>

The Industry Data for Society Partnership (IDSP) seeks to support public data actors in overcoming these challenges and aims to talk about the issues they face in a panel session.</abstract>

        <abstract> X-Road&amp;reg; is open-software and ecosystem solution that provides unified and secure data exchange between organisations. X-Road is a digital public good verified by the Digital Public. X-Road is used as a national data exchange solution in Estonia, Finland, Iceland and many other countries around the world.To better understand the direct and tangible environmental impacts of the use of X-Road, the current emissions profile was assessed by a research project. As a result, an emissions calculator to assess X-Road's environmental footprint was built. The calculator gives an estimate of the total carbon footprint of X-Road, as well as its individual components.The main scope of the presentation is to discuss how to evaluate environmental footprint of an open-source software.</abstract>

        <abstract> As you're building an organization, finding the right people to join is critical. Whether you're hiring a team member or bringing on an advisor, they can be your friend or foe. Knowing how to utilize those advisors is crucial. The right elements will help you scale, while the wrong choices will slow you down. Kelly has spent the past three years leading a nonprofit organization. She has hired and lost a team member, brought on volunteer leaders, and implemented an advisory board. Some of these choices were good, and she would repeat them. Others, have not turned out as well and have served as learning experiences. Join her as she shares lessons learned, provides suggestions on how to find the right people, and facilitates discussion on how to maximize your opportunities and spend to scale.</abstract>

        <abstract> How Open Ownership helps countries produce high-quality beneficial ownership data via the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard and encourages countries to make it openly or publicly available. Beneficial ownership (BO) data is used to investigate corruption and &amp;ldquo;follow the money&amp;rdquo;. This data is helping to reduce corruption risks and deliver real-life impacts to prevent and combat corruption, especially when it is structured and can be connected with other BO information and datasets from across the world, and easily exchanged &amp;ndash; in other words, when BO data is interoperable. Beneficial ownership transparency brings to light who owns, controls, and benefits from companies and other corporate vehicles (beneficial owners). Beneficial ownership (BO) data is used to investigate corruption and &amp;ldquo;follow the money&amp;rdquo;. This data is helping to reduce corruption risks and deliver real-life impacts to prevent and combat corruption, especially when it is structured and can be connected with other BO information and datasets from across the world, and easily exchanged &amp;ndash; in other words, when BO data is interoperable. Recognising the power of BOT, over 60 countries now have live BO registers, and at least 20 more countries are working towards launching one. The world is set to generate more BO data than ever before. This presents exciting opportunities as well as practical challenges, namely: How to ensure BO data is used to its fullest potential to prevent and combat transnational corruption?</abstract>

        <abstract> Founders and maintainers of open source projects have a good idea of what is needed from a technology standpoint to grow their project and provide technology value. But there are many other things to consider such as how to talk about the business value, marketing activities, and community building that gives the project the needed boost that accelerates the time to project success.

In this talk, I will bring my experience and insights on best practices for marketing, advocacy, and community building for open source projects that you can use to help you grow your project.

        <abstract> The "classic" model of an Open Source Program Office has been a centralized organizational resource that serves as a technical, legal, and cultural resource for all things open source in an organization.

But the growing success of open source may be putting a unique form of pressure on the existence of OSPOs. In organizations where community best practices are in general use, the need for a large centralized OSPO may be perceived as unnecessary. If everyone knows how open source works, the argument goes, why do you need an OSPO?

In this talk, Red Hat OSPO's Brian Proffitt will describe how even in a mature open source organization, OSPOs are still very necessary, but that their shape might change.</abstract>

        <abstract> More and more apps are being developed which consume AI. AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017 and companies are promoting an AI first strategy. But if a developer wants to consume AI in their applications, do they need to be an AI expert?

In this talk app developers will learn how they can treat AI the same as any other "function". This is made possible by open source AI frameworks that enables users to manage models through dev friendly APIs. Discussion will revolve around open source frameworks like Ray, Triton and TorchServe, to give an understanding of the tools available to help on the AI journey. I'll demo a runtime in action by loading open source models from Hugging Face and querying the models through a web UI.</abstract>

This of course quickly spiraled out of control and evolved into a general purpose linux based pc booter video playing thing.

        <abstract> Internal developer platforms are inherently bespoke to an organisation because, well, they are internal! At the same time, they are most effective when built as a thin layer above a number of other, lower level platforms that may be less custom. This talk will showcase how three OSS solutions are teaming up to enable an end to end platform experience that can empower organisations to forego settling on third party proprietary software without paying an unreasonable cost to build their solution in house.</abstract>

        <abstract> Because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many engineers and admins try to avoid upgrading the kernel too often for the sake of stability. There is a tendency to create more obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals etc). But introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any other software usually significantly increases the risk for the company and their service of being exploited.

One of the reasons SREs and engineers are afraid of ANY kernel upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about the Linux kernel release process. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix release from a feature release.</abstract>

        <abstract> This talk explores the world of firmware, the most privileged software that powers every device, and is traditional proprietary. We will dive into the history of firmware to understand its evolution and focus on how open-source firmware has been gaining ground over the past two decades.

Despite facing challenges in gaining widespread acceptance within the industry, open-source firmware has made significant leaps forward in recent years. These advancements show the growing momentum of open-source firmware. In our discussion, we'll highlight these key successes and try to answer the most important question: Is now the time for open-source firmware to truly succeed and become the universal standard?</abstract>

        <abstract> X-Road&amp;reg; is open-software and ecosystem solution that provides unified and secure data exchange between organisations. X-Road is a digital public good verified by the Digital Public. X-Road is used as a national data exchange solution in Estonia, Finland, Iceland and many other countries around the world.To better understand the direct and tangible environmental impacts of the use of X-Road, the current emissions profile was assessed by a research project. As a result, an emissions calculator to assess X-Road's environmental footprint was built. The calculator gives an estimate of the total carbon footprint of X-Road, as well as its individual components.The main scope of the presentation is to discuss how to evaluate environmental footprint of an open-source software.</abstract>

Stream formed in Apr-20 when a group of 11 water companies came together &amp; validated the need for open data in the sector
The group felt that if the benefits of open data in the sector were to be maximised then collaboration would be the best way to go - on the basis that if you want to go fast, go it alone but if you want to go far, go together
Since then, more water companies, regulators, &amp; SMEs have come on board &amp; Stream was successful in securing delivery funding earlier this year from the Ofwat innovation fund

        <abstract> Health inequality is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. In this panel discussion, we will explore how data has the power to address health disparities and revolutionise healthcare, particularly if we look beyond clinical data alone. And how new approaches to data stewardship are needed to help unlock the full power of data to improve health and save lives, and to do this in a trustworthy way to forge a path towards a healthier and more equitable future for all.</abstract>

        <abstract> Leveraging Privately Sourced Datasets: Despite their promise to provide useful insights to public sector policymakers, program designers, and researchers, privately sourced datasets have typically been difficult for public sector actors to obtain, analyze, and leverage for public benefit. The Industry Data for Society Partnership (IDSP) seeks to support public data actors in overcoming these challenges and aims to talk about the issues they face in a panel session.</abstract>

        <abstract> How Open Ownership helps countries produce high-quality beneficial ownership data via the Beneficial Ownership Data Standard and encourages countries to make it openly or publicly available. Beneficial ownership (BO) data is used to investigate corruption and &amp;ldquo;follow the money&amp;rdquo;. This data is helping to reduce corruption risks and deliver real-life impacts to prevent and combat corruption, especially when it is structured and can be connected with other BO information and datasets from across the world, and easily exchanged &amp;ndash; in other words, when BO data is interoperable. Beneficial ownership transparency brings to light who owns, controls, and benefits from companies and other corporate vehicles (beneficial owners). Beneficial ownership (BO) data is used to investigate corruption and &amp;ldquo;follow the money&amp;rdquo;. This data is helping to reduce corruption risks and deliver real-life impacts to prevent and combat corruption, especially when it is structured and can be connected with other BO information and datasets from across the world, and easily exchanged &amp;ndash; in other words, when BO data is interoperable. Recognising the power of BOT, over 60 countries now have live BO registers, and at least 20 more countries are working towards launching one. The world is set to generate more BO data than ever before. This presents exciting opportunities as well as practical challenges, namely: How to ensure BO data is used to its fullest potential to prevent and combat transnational corruption?</abstract>

        <abstract> SBOM’s are the hot new thing in security - everyone wants one, but no-one is quite sure what they do with them. In this talk we’ll dig into the picnic baskets of the SBOM campground, hoping to uncover some tasty morsels about the emerging SBOM lifecycle. I’ll cover topics like where we should create, store and distribute them, how can we prove they can be trusted, and adding sauce to the sandwich with enrichment and companion formats. Come and join the party - Yabba Dabba Doo!</abstract>

        <abstract> The CHERIoT Platform is the result of a hardware-software co-design project to build a secure foundation for embedded, connected devices. The project began at Microsoft and is now developed by multiple companies. The core platform includes an open ISA, an open-source core implementing that ISA, and an open-source software stack. With a very small hardware budget, this provides complete memory safety for legacy C/C++ code, and lightweight compartmentalisation that is easy to apply. Commercial silicon is expected in 2024.</abstract>

        <abstract> Today, almost all software heavily relies on the use of third-party dependencies. While open source modules are undoubtedly awesome, they also represent an undeniable and massive risk. You’re introducing someone else’s code into your system, often with little or no scrutiny. Including the wrong package can introduce severe vulnerabilities, exposing your application and your user’s data.

We’ll look at examples in the wild that have been exposed, some more famously than others, before showing you how to guard against these important security issues.</abstract>

        <abstract> As more Banks &amp; Financial Service firms adopt Open Source, there’s been a huge spike in Open Source patent attacks. According to research from RPX, from 2020-21 industry patent litigation grew by 100%, almost 3 times more than the next closest sector. In 2023, the use of Kubernetes, Docker, Kafka, Spark &amp; Node.js have all been subjects of lawsuits filed against Financial Service companies. Global Banks &amp; Financial Service companies — from Barclays &amp; NatWest to Uber &amp; Worldline — are not only turning to Open Source for technology innovation but they are also being proactive, seeking alternative solutions for patent risk protection &amp; revising patent strategies.</abstract>

        <abstract> Join this session to hear how the Citi OSPO reduces process friction to allow developers to focus on contributing code to open source projects. We’ll cover how Citi designed our Open Source contribution policy to have a streamlined low-touch governance work-flow (for things like approvals, mitigating risk, and user agreements) and use tooling to prevent data leakage. Hear real-life practical examples of how contributing to open source has improved the Citi developer experience, diversity of thought, productivity, code quality and security.</abstract>
